## Abstract
Pain treatment disparities across socioeconomic-status (SES) are explained by beliefs that low-SES individuals are less sensitive to physical pain. Similarly, Black individuals are seen as inured to social pain (e.g., ostracism). The current work investigated whether biases in social pain judgments extend to low-SES individuals and academic-related consequences. While Study 1 found that low- and high-SES individuals were judged as equally sensitive to socially painful events, Study 2 revealed that low-SES students received longer accommodations, and were seen as more pitiful and less competent, which related to substandard projected academic performance.
